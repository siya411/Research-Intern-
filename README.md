# ESG Analysis of Sustainability Reports from Indian Companies
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sustainability reports from top Indian companies to uncover key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) trends. Using advanced text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project reveals significant ESG themes, benchmarks corporate performance, and identifies strategic improvement areas.

# Project Features

# Data Source:
Sustainability reports from Indian companies (publicly available reports from company websites, government portals, etc.).
# Techniques Used:
Text Mining
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Sentiment Analysis
Topic Modeling using LDA

Objective

Benchmark ESG strategies, identify key themes, and derive actionable insights for corporate sustainability performance.

Key Steps

Data Collection:
Compiled sustainability reports from top Indian companies across various sectors.
Converted reports from PDF format into text using OCR tools where necessary.

Text Preprocessing:
Cleaned and normalized text (removal of stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant content).
Tokenized text for further analysis.

Topic Modeling:
Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify distinct ESG-related themes.
Identified key topics such as carbon emissions, resource efficiency, social impact, and governance practices.

Sentiment Analysis:
Employed sentiment analysis tools (VADER) to gauge the overall tone of ESG reporting.
Compared sentiment scores across sectors and companies to highlight leaders in positive reporting.

Quantitative Analysis:
Extracted key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sustainability, such as energy consumption, carbon reduction goals, and community investment.
Benchmarked companies' ESG performance against industry standards.

Visualization:
Created visual representations of key ESG trends using Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Displayed trends and benchmarks across industries and companies.
