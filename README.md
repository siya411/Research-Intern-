# ESG Analysis of Sustainability Reports from Indian Companies

The project delves into the sustainability practices of leading Indian companies, aiming to uncover key trends in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects. Enhancing advanced text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project analyzes publicly available sustainability reports to reveal significant ESG themes, benchmark corporate performance, and identify areas for strategic improvement.

The data for this analysis was sourced from sustainability reports of top Indian companies across diverse sectors, often converting PDFs into text using OCR tools where necessary. Text preprocessing involved cleaning and normalizing the data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant content, followed by tokenizing the text for further analysis. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied for topic modeling, which helped identify distinct ESG-related themes such as carbon emissions, resource efficiency, social impact, and governance practices. Additionally, sentiment analysis using the VADER tool provided insights into the tone of ESG reporting, allowing for a comparison of sentiment scores across different sectors and highlighting companies with a positive approach to sustainability.

Quantitative analysis involved extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sustainability, such as energy consumption, carbon reduction goals, and community investment. These KPIs were used to benchmark the ESG performance of companies against industry standards. Visualizations of the key trends were created using Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, offering a clear representation of ESG performance across various industries.

The analysis revealed key themes like carbon emissions reduction, waste management, social equity, and transparency in corporate governance. Sentiment analysis showed that sectors such as technology and energy reported ESG efforts with a more positive tone compared to others. Companies that stood out were those prioritizing carbon neutrality and social responsibility initiatives. Moving forward, the project intends to expand the dataset to include more companies and sectors, and to incorporate advanced NLP techniques for a deeper understanding of governance and social issues.

This project was implemented using Python for data manipulation and analysis, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim for topic modeling, along with VADER for sentiment analysis. Data visualization was achieved through Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau, all managed in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The projectâ€™s findings provide actionable insights for improving corporate sustainability strategies while establishing industry benchmarks for ESG performance.
